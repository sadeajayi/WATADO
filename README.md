# WATADO

To currently run application:
1. Open your terminal and navigate to where you want the app to be downloaded to.
2. Clone the app to the folder like so: git clone https://bitbucket.org/sadeajayi/watado 
3. run "node app.js"
4. In your browser, run localhost:3000
5. In my opinion, running "nodemon" makes everything easier
6. If you dont have nodemon installed first run "npm install nodemon"
7. Then run nodemon
