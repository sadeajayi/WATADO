# WATADO

### To currently run application:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to where you want the app to be downloaded to.

2. Clone the app to the folder like so: git clone https://bitbucket.org/sadeajayi/watado 

3. Install the node dependencies (express, body-parser, mongoose, express-session, connect-mongo). By running command `npm install <dependency-name>`

4. After installing all required dependencies, start mongodb in new terminal by running command `mongod`. This starts the mongo database service.

5. On a new terminal, launch the app with command `npm start` or `node index.js`

6. The app should start without errors - if the database connection was successful. In your browser, open the app by entering URL: `localhost:3000`
